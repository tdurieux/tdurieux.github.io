Failure-oblivious computing is one technique that aims to achieve high availability. We note that failure-obliviousness has not been studied in depth yet, and there is very few study that helps understand why failure-oblivious techniques work. In order to make failure-oblivious computing to have an impact in practice, we need to deeply understand failure-oblivious behaviors in software. In this paper, we study, design and perform an experiment that analyzes the size and the diversity of the failure-oblivious behaviors. Our experiment consists of exhaustively computing the search space of 16 field failures of large-scale open-source Java software. The outcome of this experiment is a much better understanding of what really happens when failure-oblivious computing is used, and this opens new promising research directions.")]),e._v(" "),a("div",{staticClass:"language-bibtex extra-class"},[a("pre",{pre:!0,attrs:{class:"language-text"}},[a("code",[e._v("@inproceedings{durieux2017exhaustive,\nauthor = {Durieux, Thomas and Hamadi, Youssef and Yu, Zhongxing and Monperrus, Martin},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Software Testing, Validation and Verification (ICST)},\norganization = {IEEE},\ntitle = {Exhaustive Exploration of the Failure-oblivious Computing Search Space},\nyear = {2018}\n}\n")])])])],2)},[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=i.exports}}]);
